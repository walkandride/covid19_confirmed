# Introduction
In my previous [report](https://rpubs.com/walkandride/595987), I went into detail about the COVID-19 curve.  Probably a bit to much detail for most people.  

We are now entering a new phase on the COVID timeline.  News about [states re-opening](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/24/coronavirus-this-is-where-all-50-states-stand-on-reopening/) now top the headlines.  It's a good time for me to pivot.

**When is a good time for a state to reopen when there is no known cure for COVID-19?**  The document *[When and How to Reopen After COVID-19](https://preventepidemics.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COV020_WhenHowLoosenFaucet_v4.pdf)* provides guidelines from three different perspectives.  

In this analysis I explore three factors based upon data on confirmed cases and data available on COVID testing.  Specifically, I'm looking at:

1.  a downward trend of confirmed cases in the last two weeks
2.  a [data quality grade](https://covidtracking.com/about-data#state-data-quality-grades) from [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com)
3.  the [positive rate in tests benchmark](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/23/842195504/morning-news-brief) (positivity rate) as defined by the World Health Organization (*the more tests that come back positive, the less likely a state is doing enough testing*).  

### Make An Informed Decision

Here's how.

1.  Find the state you're interested in.
2.  Look at the graphs.  The first graph show the number of confirmed cases for the area since its inception.  The second graph shows the confirmed cases for the last 14 days.  What is its trend?  Is the line sloping downwards?  (Note:  the actual numbers are found in the table above the graphs.)
3.  In the *Testing Results* table, locate the area state abbreviation.  What is it's grade?  What is its posRate value?
4.  Now evaluate:
    a)  Are the number of confirmed cases trending downward?  Two trend lines are provided to better visualize the trend over the last two weeks.
    b)  Does the COVID Tracking Project give a data quality grade of A or above?
    c)  Is the positive rate of tests as defined by the WHO less than 10%?
    d)  Those values in the table that meet or exceed minimum recommended requirements are <span style="color:green">**green**</span>; those slightly above the threshold are <span style="color:orange">**orange**</span>.
